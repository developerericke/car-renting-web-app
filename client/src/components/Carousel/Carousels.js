        The points to be covered The number of points that you need to cover in
        your essay should determine the number of paragraphs that you are going
        to include in your essay. Each paragraph revolves around a single idea
        that connects to the central idea of your essay. In the planning of your
        essay, you will have to consider and research on all the major elements
        that are required in the body text. You can assume that each paragraph
        will take each one of these ideas. Availability of information needed to
        cover each area will require you to have more paragraphs. That is the
        answer to how long should college essays be? The content is crucial than
        the number of paragraphs Whether you are writing a long or a short
        essay, the content of your essay is of high importance. It doesnâ€™t
        matter how long are college essays going to be. The evaluation of your
        essay hinges on the information that you present, not the number of
        paragraphs in your paper. At times, you will be given an essay stricture
        and a guideline on the length of each part. In other instances, you will
        You must examine your evidence to be able to answer this question. In
        other words, you are demonstrating the truth of your claim. This
        question comes early in your essay and most cases, directly after the
        introduction. However, it should not take up more than a third of your
        entire essay to ensure balance. How? The reader will want to ascertain
        the truth of your claims in all classes. You have to show how your
        thesis defends itself from the counter-arguments. The reader also wants
        to see how the introduction of new material, as well as new ways of
        looking at the evidence, influence the claims that you are making. This
        section comes after what and can make its argument complicated severally
        depending on its length. The counter-argument may appear anywhere in the
        essay. Why?
